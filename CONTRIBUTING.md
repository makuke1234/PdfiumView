# Contributing

This project is by no means perfect. Feel free to report any bugs, that you may find, under
**[Issues](https://github.com/makuke1234/PdfiumView/issues)**.
Also feel free to make any feature requests that come into your mind. Currently our end goal
is to achieve a PDF viewer that's super fast and lightweight. It should be **sooo** much better
than the competition. That's the philosophy here...
